In this project, I had the opportunity to write multithreaded object-oriented code using Java frameworks and determine how to deploy software applications using cloud services.
I modified a Spring application with a Java back end and an Angular front end to include multithreaded language translation, a message at different time zones, and currency exchange. Then, build a Docker image of the current multithreaded Spring application and containerize it using the supporting documents provided in this task.

This project gave me extensive knowledge of the use of Spring frameworks, java for back-end development, Angular for front-end development, and the creation of docker images.
